## Intrdouction
A museum can contain artworks dating back to more than hundred years ago from over thousands of creators. With the large amount of image data on hand, we can build machine learning models that enable us to accomplish a variety of goals. Some examples include finding trends in artworks throughout the history, instant art image recognition, and artwork generation, etc., all of which are our motivations for pursuing this problem. And we majorly focus on the classification problem and furthermore, multitasking classification.

Our Artwork Recognition project focuses on all kinds of museum artwork image classification. It mainly contains two parts: single-task classification and multitasking classification. We want make better classication model than baseline on single-task classification. Then We according to strong information correlation, do the multitasking classification and outperform than KKN method, which is considered as baseline.

## Single-task Image Classification
There are 3 different single-task classification: type, material and creator. Each of them has a image selection jupyter notebook file and also a classification jupyter notebook file. 

### Image Selection process

### classification model training



## Multi-task Image Classification
Similarly, there will be image selection process as well as a model training fil.
### Image Selection process

### classification model training
